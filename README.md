# CompSciNotes
location for all my computational science notes from numerical analysis to high performance computing
to be implemented after/during spring 2027

plan:
- add PhysicsNotes, CompSciNotes
- adjust navbar dropdown to reveal links:
  - CircuitNotes
  - MathNotes
  - PhysNotes
  - CompSciNotes
  - Independent Research 
-  and when you hover over one of them:
  - CircuitNotes > - MasterRef
  - MathNotes    | - BasicCircuits
  - PhysicsNotes | - {... rest of them}
  - CompSciNotes
  - Independent Research
(hover over one of them, arrow pointing to the right appears, additional links appear to the side from hidden.)
*all links are active, this is displayed by a slight color change*
